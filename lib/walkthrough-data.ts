        title: "The Voodoo Strikes Back",
        content: "Time to channel your inner MacGyver! Visit the Voodoo Lady (who probably moonlights as a life coach for troubled pirates) and create a voodoo doll using items that would make Marie Kondo question your life choices."

        title: "Caribbean Feng Shui",

        title: "Garden of Earthly Delights",
        content: "Explore the governor's mansion gardens, which look like what would happen if Tim Burton designed for Better Homes & Gardens. Watch out for the spitting contest - it's less about accuracy and more about starting international incidents."
